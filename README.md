Express Lab

Purpose From Curriculum Development Team: This lab assumes that learners spent the entire day following the instructor as they built routes for the first time in Express. Learners are expected to not at all be comfortable yet with the terminology of the backend, or in building things with the backend. This Lab/HW is their first opportunity to take chances, make mistakes and get messy with the actual writing of backend code, they should also see the synergy between what they reviewed yesterday in the Callbacks assignment. This assignment is successful if learners complete with a greater understanding of what they did in class and way more questions about express.




Intro
It's been a long day and you've covered a lot of ground.

It's natural, in fact, expected, to feel "uncomfortable" and confused by Node.js & Express at this point.

As always, the journey toward competence requires practice - so let's get on with it!




Exercise
The goal of the exercise is to do put in a rep doing everything that you did during the Express lesson!

This lab is a deliverable
Build 10 Routes and a view engine, say anything you want
Make 2 different templates, and use them both in different routes ( you can only have 1 view engine but multiple templates )
Bonus
Dynamically add links to your view engine so you can make anchor tags to link your pages together, hmmm how would you do that ….. hint split , loop , you can figure it out, but it will take a lot of problem solving, you'll have to do more than change one line of code, but it will only take a few lines of code, use an array or object another hint.
Super Bonus
This is an advanced bonus that previews what we will soon learn in class, I didn't teach you any of this but your free to research it's not required at all…

Create a route and view dedicated to displaying a single data resource, such as a single student.

We refer to this as the show route/view, vs. the index route/view.

The key to implementing this feature is route parameters documented in the Route parameters section of the Express Routing guide (Links to an external site.).

Basically, you can define a route as follows:

// have some object with a bunch of learners
// edit your view engine as needed and don't copy this code
// word for word, bar for bar, its just an idea

app.get('/learners/:id', function(req, res) {
  console.log(`The value for the :id route parameter is: ${req.params.id}`);
  res.render('learners/show', { learnerId: req.params.id, learnerName: learnerObject[req.params.id].name });
});
To send a matching route from the browser, you can use an html a tag that generates a hyperlink that looks like:

" <a href="/learners/ ##learnerId##">
  Click for Details for Student ##studentName##>
</a> "
